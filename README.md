# face-detection-using-python
This project implements a facial recognition system designed to identify a specific individual from a group of people based on their pre-stored single images. Using Python and key libraries like OpenCV and face_recognition (built on dlib), the system extracts facial features from known images and matches them against detected faces in a group photo. The process begins with a training phase, where individual images of known persons are loaded from a specified directory (train/). Each image is processed to extract facial encodings, which are stored along with corresponding names. These encodings serve as reference data for recognizing individuals in subsequent test images.

During the recognition phase, a test image containing multiple people is provided as input. The program detects all faces in the image and encodes them. It then compares these encodings against the stored dataset using Euclidean distance, determining the best match for each detected face. If a match is found, the identified personâ€™s name is displayed on the image. To enhance visualization, the program draws a rectangle around detected faces and labels them with the recognized name. Finally, the processed image is saved in an output directory for further use.

The project utilizes OpenCV for image processing, face_recognition for feature extraction and comparison, and NumPy for numerical computations. This system has several practical applications, including security authentication, automated attendance tracking, and group photo tagging. The current implementation is optimized for recognizing a limited number of individuals, but future enhancements could include improving recognition accuracy with deep learning models, supporting real-time video processing, and extending recognition capabilities to larger groups. The setup is simple: users need to store single images of known individuals in a training directory, provide a test image with multiple people, and run the script to identify the person from the group. The output image with labeled faces is then saved automatically.
